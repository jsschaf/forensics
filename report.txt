1. What specific behaviors of this machine make booting normally a bad idea?
    A anti-theft system asks for a system password before botting the operating system. However, if you input the incorrect password (evidence 1.0) the hard drive will purge itself (evidence 1.1, 1.2). Therefore, as a forensic investigator, we only have one chance to get into the hard drive or else it will delete all of the information on the hard drive.


2. What operating system does the suspect use?
#24-Ubuntu x86_64

3. What is the username of the account typically used by the suspect?
    Ubuntu->Advanced Options with Ubuntu -> (recovery mode) -> resume -> Ubuntu login page with user "Leslie Nielson"


4. Any indication that the suspect shared the company secrets with other individuals?

    Yes there is indication that the suspect shared the company secrets. There is a hidden message in 1.jpg. Using a steganographic decoder, we were able to find an internal SDSC email telling Alex to dump Bungle stock (evidence 4.0). This message was sent to "5H3PH3RD" which we found in "#private.log" under /home/leslie/.irssi/logs/ (evidence 4.1). We have also found a hidden chat room on https://weratepups.xyz/ where he says he has a way to get back at SDSC, indicating that he has/will intend to either release or share the company secret (eivdence 4.2).

5. Reconstruct the timeline of actions by the suspect that may be relevant

- March 11, 2am: chat between Art3m15 (Leslie) and 5H3PH3RD discussing list of vulnerable hosts (evidence 5.2)
- March 11 7pm Deleted Tor Browser (evidence 5.1)
- March 15 1pm did a backup with suspicious stuff, like testmalware  (evidence 5.3)
- March 15 8pm deleted bash history (evidence 5.5)
- March 15 8pm deleted insurance and planning on (evidence 5.0)
- March 15 8pm delete a bunch of stuff (evident in authlog evidence5.4.txt)
- November 8th Chat begins on weratepups.xyz (evidence 5.7)
- November 15th Artemis sends final message on weratepups.xyz (Evidence 5.6)

There is an inconsistency in the timeline. It appears Leslie is still active and on the run after March. 


6. Anything else on the computer that would imply the suspect had malicious intents in using this computer?
- Deleting Bash History
- Using Tor in general
- Visiting suspicious webpages in firefox such as piratebay and freearabsexx.com (evidence 6.0)

7. Any suspicious-looking encrypted files on the machine? Attach decrypted contents (if possible) as evidence and briefly describe how you obtained the contents.

    Under leslie/Documents there is a zipped file called "secrets.zip" that is password protected. Using fzipcrack we were able to brute force a password "6f7y" (evidence 7.0)
    Once decrypted, we found there to be 1.jpg, 2.jpg, contract.mp3, and secret_exe (evidence 7.1). Unzipping the folder it will show us that 2.jpg is nearly 3x greater in size than 1.jpg. We then renamed 2.jpg into 2.zip and opened it showing two more files. "good_advice.png" and "plan.png" (evidence 7.2). We explored contract.mp3 using a sonic visualizer and by applying a spectogram to the waveform, we discover a message "PP4m#36ajK1mu" (evidence 7.3). When we open secret_exe using a text editor, we discover plain text "the password is "ke9dtcesm6f"" (evidence 7.4)

- jpg1 had steg which said to drop bungle stock

8. Did the suspect try to delete any files before their arrest? Please attach the name(s) of the file(s) and any indications of their contents that you can find.
	insurance.txt
	planning.png

9. List all other secrets, and other findings.
    At least 212 Possible Zip Bombs (evidence 9.0)

    Agent User to get into the concieled chat is 86753 (evidence 9.1)

10. 
a.This file indicates that the user running SDSC’s website was trying to log in to a machine that it did not have credentials for. They were using port 22 which is the ssh port, and so were tring to get remote access to root on sshd, CRON (a time-based job scheduler), tty1 (text only terminal) and PAM (pluggable authentication module). They successfully gained access to root and changed the password to “chauthtok” after finding user ‘nefarious’. 

b. This auth.log suggests that the user was trying to brute force a password. This suggests a program such as THC-HydrU or Hydra5-4, both of which can use a dictionary attack to crack SSH passwords.
