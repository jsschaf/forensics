1. What specific behaviors of this machine make booting normally a bad idea?
    There is an anti-theft system that asks for a bios password before booting the operating system. If an incorrect password (evidence 1.0) is detected, the hard drive will purge itself (evidence 1.1) making it impossible to get into (evidence 1.2). As forensic investigators, we must find a backdoor to get around the anti-theft system.

2. What operating system does the suspect use?


3. What is the username of the account typically used by the suspect?
    The username of the account typically used by the suspect is "Leslie Nielson" (evidence 3.0). The suspect also uses the online alias "Artemis" (evidence 3.1).

4. Any indication that the suspect shared the company secrets with other individuals?
    There is indication that the supect has shared the company secrets. There is a hidden message in 1.jpg which contains an internal SDSC email telling Alex to dump Bungle stock (evidence 4.0). A top secret SDSC memo was leaked (evidence 4.1), we believe by the suspect because a file on their device named "secret_exe" had the password to unlock the SDSC memo (evidence 4.2). A top secret SDSC ledger was also leaked (WE NEED TO OPEN THIS), which we also believe the suspect provided because a file on their device named "FIND THIS FILE" had the password to unlock the ledger (PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS).

5. Reconstruct the timeline of actions by the suspect that may be relevant


6. Anything else on the computer that would imply the suspect had malicious intents in using this computer?


7. Any suspicious-looking encrypted files on the machine? Attach decrypted contents (if possible) as evidence and briefly describe how you obtained the contents.
    There is a zipped file called "secrets.zip", which using password "6f7y
     (evidence 7.0), contained:
        1.jpg, which contained an internal SDSC email (evidence 4.0)
        2.jpg, which when renamed to 2.zip contained two more files "good_advice.png" and "plan.png" (evidence 7.2)
        contract.mp3, which when analyzed through a sonic visualizer revealed a message "PP4m#36ajKlmu" (evidence 7.3)
        secret_exe, which we discoevered  plain text "the password is "ke9dtcesm6f"" (evidence 4.2)

8. Did the suspect try to delete any files before their arrest? Please attach the name(s) of the file(s) and any indications of their contents that you can find.
    The suspect tried to delete the folder "finished", ".chat.log.swx", "insurance.txt", "planning.png"; however, we were able to recover these files as well as the other files that were inside of the folder finished (evidence 8.0)

9. List all other secrets, and other findings.

    At least 217 Possible Zip Bombs (evidence 9.0)
    Agent User to get into the concieled chat is 86753 (evidence 9.1)
    RSA Public key: found in id_rsa (evidence 9.2)
