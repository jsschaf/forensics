1. What specific behaviors of this machine make booting normally a bad idea?
    A anti-theft system asks for a system password before botting the operating system. However, if you input the incorrect password (evidence 1.0) the hard drive will purge itself (evidence 1.1, 1.2). Therefore, as a forensic investigator, we only have one chance to get into the hard drive or else it will delete all of the information on the hard drive.

2. What operating system does the suspect use?
#24-Ubuntu x86_64

3. What is the username of the account typically used by the suspect?
    Ubuntu->Advanced Options with Ubuntu -> (recovery mode) -> resume -> Ubuntu login page with user "Leslie Nielson"

4. Any indication that the suspect shared the company secrets with other individuals?

5. Reconstruct the timeline of actions by the suspect that may be relevant


6. Anything else on the computer that would imply the suspect had malicious intents in using this computer?
