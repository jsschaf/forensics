1. What specific behaviors of this machine make booting normally a bad idea?
    There is an anti-theft system that asks for a password before booting the operating system. If an incorrect password (evidence 1.0) is detected, the hard drive will purge itself (evidence 1.1) making it impossible to get into (evidence 1.2). As forensic investigators, we must find a backdoor to get around the anti-theft system.

2. What operating system does the suspect use?
    The suspect is using "4.13.0-21-genertic #24-Ubuntu" (evidence 2.0).

3. What is the username of the account typically used by the suspect?
    The username of the account typically used by the suspect is "Leslie Nielson" (evidence 3.0). The suspect also uses the online alias "Artemis" (evidence 3.1) or "Artm3m15" (evidence 8.2).

4. Any indication that the suspect shared the company secrets with other individuals?

    Yes there is indication that the suspect shared the company secrets. There is a hidden message in 1.jpg. Using a steganographic decoder, we were able to find an internal SDSC email telling Alex to dump Bungle stock (evidence 4.0). This message was sent to "5H3PH3RD" which we found in "#private.log" under /home/leslie/.irssi/logs/ (evidence 4.1). We have also found a hidden chat room on https://weratepups.xyz/ where he says he has a way to get back at SDSC, indicating that he has/will intend to either release or share the company secret (eivdence 4.2).

5. Reconstruct the timeline of actions by the suspect that may be relevant

- March 11, 2am: chat between Art3m15 (Leslie) and 5H3PH3RD discussing list of vulnerable hosts (evidence 5.2)
- March 11 7pm Deleted Tor Browser (evidence 5.1)
- March 15 1pm did a backup with suspicious stuff, like testmalware  (evidence 5.3)
- March 15 8pm deleted bash history (evidence 5.5)
- March 15 8pm deleted insurance and planning on (evidence 5.0)
- March 15 8pm delete a bunch of stuff (evident in authlog evidence5.4.txt)
- November 8th Chat begins on weratepups.xyz (evidence 5.7)
- November 15th Artemis sends final message on weratepups.xyz (Evidence 5.6)

There is an inconsistency in the timeline. It appears Leslie is still active and on the run after March. 

6. Anything else on the computer that would imply the suspect had malicious intents in using this computer?
- Deleting Bash History
- Using Tor in general
- Visiting suspicious webpages in firefox such as piratebay and freearabsexx.com (evidence 6.0) Also visited metasploit.com which is a website for detecting security vulnerabilities. Leslie could have used it for illegal penetration testing. There is also a link to hamhash.com/not, which shows Leslie used a temporary URL, maybe for malicious reasons. 

7. Any suspicious-looking encrypted files on the machine? Attach decrypted contents (if possible) as evidence and briefly describe how you obtained the contents.
    There is a zipped file called "secrets.zip", which using password "6f7y
     (evidence 7.0), contained
        - 1.jpg, which contained an internal SDSC email (evidence 4.0)
        - 2.jpg, which when renamed to 2.zip contained two more files "good_advice.png" and "plan.png" (evidence 7.2)
        - contract.mp3, which when analyzed through a sonic visualizer revealed a message "PP4m#36ajK1mu" (evidence 4.4)
        - secret_exe, which we discovered plain text "the password is "ke9dtcesm6f"" (evidence 4.2)

8. Did the suspect try to delete any files before their arrest? Please attach the name(s) of the file(s) and any indications of their contents that you can find.
    The suspect tried to delete the folder "finished" and files ".chat.log.swx", "insurance.txt", and "planning.png"
        - We found the folder "finished" (evidence 8.0) which contained many images as well as multiple files
        - "finished" contained a document that would eventually be "insurance.txt" (evidence 8.1) 
        - We recovered ".chat.log.swx" (evidence 8.2) using Autopsy
        - We found "planning.png" in 2.jpg from part 7 (evidence 7.2, 8.3).
    The suspected deleted the contents from "bash_history" (evidence 5.5)

9. List all other secrets, and other findings.

    217 Possible Zip Bombs: Using Autopsy, we were alerted to 217 possible zip bombs (evidence 9.0)
    Leslie's Ubuntu Password: Used John the Ripper to find the password "copper" (evidence 9.1)
    info.pdf password: Inside the recovered chat log (evidence 8.2), we got a link to a password protected pdf. We cracked the pdf, discovering password "beacon" (evidence 9.2)
    Agent user: We used a python script (agent.py) to brute force https://weratepups.xyz in order to find the agent user, 86753, to real a concealed chat (evidence 9.3)
    RSA Public key: found in id_rsa (evidence 9.4) in order to confirm our identity in the conconcealed chat
    insurance.txt: Discovered the members of The Collective when recovered the folder "finished" (evidence 8.1)
    Employee Badge: There is a SDSC Auditor - All Access employee badge (evidence 9.5)

10.
    a. What does this file indicate? (Be specific)
        This file indicates that the user running SDSC’s website was trying to log in to a machine that it did not have credentials for. They were using port 22 which is the ssh port, and so were tring to get remote access to root on sshd, CRON (a time-based job scheduler), tty1 (text only terminal) and PAM (pluggable authentication module). They successfully gained access to root and changed the password to “chauthtok” after finding user ‘nefarious’

    b. Can you attribute this behavior to a specific program?
        This auth.log suggests that the suspect was trying to brute force a password. This suggests a program such as THC-HydrU or Hydra5-4, both of which can use a dictionary attack to crack SSH passwords.
